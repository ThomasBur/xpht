**XPHT** provides a method for computing shape statistics of binary images through extended persistent homology. Details on the mathematics behind this can be found in *paper*.

# Extracting Boundary Contours of Binary Images

**XPHT** reads in images through the [Imager package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/index.html)
