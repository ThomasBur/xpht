Description: An implementation of the extended persistent homology
    transform (XPHT) for shape statistics of two dimensional binary
    images. This is done by computing the extended persistent homology of
    the boundary curves of the image in multiple evenly spaced directions
    similar to Turner et al. (2014) <doi:10.1093/imaiai/iau011>.  
    We offer functionality for plotting extended persistence diagrams and 
    barcodes as well as the Wasserstein \eqn{p} distance matrix.
